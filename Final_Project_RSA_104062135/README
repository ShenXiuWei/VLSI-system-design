--How to Simulate
Put all files in the same directory , enter the following command:

$ make sim_1d
It will start simulation design on example 1_d.

$ make sim_v
It will start verify the output generated by key example 4_d.
To see if the data_output_verify.txt is same as data_input.txt 

$ make syn_v
It will start verify the output generated by key example 4_d.
To see if the data_output_verify.txt is same as data_input.txt
